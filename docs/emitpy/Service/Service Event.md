Events are a special type of aircraft service that does not involve or produce a movement of ground support vehicle.

For example, when an aircraft arrives, the following events occur:
- First and last passager exits the aircraft,
- Cabin crew exits the aircraft
- Cargo doors are open
- Etc.
All these events can be scheduled and recorded, without producing the movement of a vehicle.
