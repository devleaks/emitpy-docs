# Aircraft Type

An aircraft type is a ICAO Aircraft Type Designator.
Aircraft Type also has:

- Manufacturer
- Model name
- Aircraft type (for airliners, aircraft class)

Aircraft Type optionally has:

- Number of engines
- Type of engine
- Wingspan
- Length
- Landing gear width
- A list of either alternate, or closely similar aircraft type designators
- A list of equivalent IATA aircraft type designators

### Aircraft Type Equivalence
There is a special file `aircraft-equivalence` that list ICAO and IATA code close equivalence.

```yaml
A321:
    - "321"
    - "32S"
    - "A21N"
```

# Aircraft Class
The Aircraft Class is an aircraft attribute based on aircraft length and/or wingspan.
There is a procedure to attempt to automagically determine the class of an aircraft.

The Aircraft Class is used as a fall back aircraft model when some data is missing.

An Aircraft Class is an Aircraft Type with special keyword *class* `CLASS` and a keyword *type*  `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, or `F`.

When the aircraft class cannot be found, aircraft class `C` is used.

For a given class, all data from a typical aircraft of that class is used. There is a class for Ã©quivalence in Airbus aicraft models, and one for Boeing aircraft models.

| class | Airbus    | Boeing   |
| ----- | --------- | -------- |
| A     | A318      | B731        |
| B     | A320      | B737-800 |
| C     | A321neo-LR      | B787     |
| D     | A350-900 or A330-800 | B777-300     |
| E     | A340-600      | B747-800     |
| F     | A380-800      | -        |

# Aircraft With Performance
An aircraft with performance is a Aircraft Type augmented with Eurocontrol BADA performance data. Performance data is almost exclusively kinematic.

# Aircraft
An Aircraft is an airframe with a registration number and an ICAO 24bit hexadecimal ADS-B emitter address. It may also contain its serial number if available.

# Aircraft Ground Support Equipment Profile

The Aircraft Ground Support Equipment Profile is a set of 3D oriented positions relative to the tip nose of the aircraft. These positions are used to place ground support equipment vehicle around the aircraft frame.
There is such a file for each AircraftType. If a profile cannot be found for a precise aircraft type, a profile is searched for similar types. If no profile can be found, the class profile is used. If no class profile can be found, the default, standard, always available class `C` is used.
