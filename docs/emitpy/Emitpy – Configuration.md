The hardest part when using Emitpy is to collect all necessary data it’s needs to run properly.

Data consists of:

(Globally)

- Airspace data ranking from waypoints, fixes, and airways, to airport flight procedures.

(For the Managed Airport)

- Networks of taxiways and service roads,
- Point of interest with Emitpy naming convention,

Optionally, for more realism:

- Weather information source (METAR, TAF, grib2 files…)
