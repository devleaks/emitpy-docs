A Ramp is the generic name for a parking for an aircraft. It can either be a parking at a passenger gate, or a "tie-down" parking on an remote apron.

A Ramp is a resource because it can obviously only be occupied by one aircraft at a time.

Ramps are sometimes divided into two or more smaller parking areas.

Emitpy does not manage ramp allocation, it only monitors it, reporting a potential issue if a ramp is over used.
