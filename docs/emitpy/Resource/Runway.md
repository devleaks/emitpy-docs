Runway allocation is *monitored* through the Emitpy application. Emitpy does not schedule runway usage, but monitors it.

A Runway is "busy"

- when an aircraft is cleared for landing until it leaves the runway at a runway exit, from about 10 miles out, or 3000ft on final approach,
- when an aircraft is clear for take-off until it reached a critical point at 1500ft AGL and accelerate.

The monitored usage is theoretical, because based on "scheduled" times and not estimated ones.
