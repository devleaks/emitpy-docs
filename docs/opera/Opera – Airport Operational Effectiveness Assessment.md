Airport Opera estimate the operational effectiveness of an airport by looking at vehicle ground movements, both aircrafts and ground support equipments.

[[Vehicle]] ground movements are monitored through [[Rule|Rules]]. A Rule express a behaviour to monitor. 

When a Vehicle follows a Rule, timing and location information is saved, analysed, compiled, and displayed on the airport operational dashboard.
